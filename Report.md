🎓 Student Management System

A Student Management System with a secure login interface that allows administrators or authorized users to manage student records digitally instead of using manual files.
The system connects to a MySQL database and provides an easy-to-use interface for adding, viewing, searching, and managing student details. It ensures secure access and centralized record management for educational institutions.

🚀 Features
